Hi, my name is Mark.

I'm a Software Engineer with an education in physics. I have an interest in a long list of topics.

This is my (work in progress) blog/project website to showcase and keep progress of my current projects.

My education background is physics and nuclear fusion technology. Through these studies I have learned a great deal about dissecting large and complex challenges in to smaller and achievable goals.

In this blog I want to showcase what I can do, and inspire other people to do the same. Through other peoples blog and tutorials I learned a great deal of new things.

For now, I focus on two projects: Making a robot that can row, and a LEGO cable track, the is more interesting than you might think at first glance. Head over to the blog posts and learn more about them.

Enjoy!
