# Rowing Robot

Can a robot row? most cannot and most robot sink, too.

Can we teach a robot to row? yes, very likely, lets find out:

Why teach a robot to row? it's fun and we might learn a thing or two. About building robots for me personal, but perhaps also about rowing itself.

Should a robot row? no, but it's fun, at the moment of writing this.

### Getting started:

To have a robot rowing in a boat we need to split to challenge in multiple parts.

We can make the split in hardware and software.

The hardware we split in to the boat and to robot. The end goal is to build a robot to row in a real boat. Since very high goal, we first start small.

So at some point we need a minuture boat.
