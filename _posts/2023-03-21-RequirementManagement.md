# Requirement Management

In the domain of engineering, independent of type, requirements are the driving force of any project [citation needed].

Without requirements there is nothing to engineer. The field of requirement engineering will be on of the starting ground tot start a project [again, citation needed]

Any projects will start with a wish, a vision or desire [I guess, I need again a citation]. Without this wish, wonder of desire there is nothing to improve on the current situation.

From this wish, vision or desire there will be requirements and usually it will end up with a lot of requirements. This is the field of requirement engineering.

## after requirements come?

So the project starts with a vision, wish or desired of what the project should do. This is usually very high level. For example:

- I want to build a tree hut
- Eliminate world hunger
- I want to build a rowing robot
- My wife wants a clean house

For simplicity we shall call these visions for the remainder of the text.

Each of these visions can be (and should be) broken down in smaller pieces. Each of these piece will be a requirement to shape the vision. Without them it would be anyones guess when the vision is achieved. Without these breakdown a tree hut might be made out of a soft material instead of steardy one.

- The tree hut shall be able to hold up to 3 children of age 10.

The next step is to determined a method to forfill the requirement. This is done by a design decision (DD).

- It is decisided that the tree hut shall be made out of wood.

From this DD more requirement can come, or a DD can forfill multiple requirements. Like for this example that the tree hut would be cheap and/or easy to build.

Keeping track of requirements and design decision can be done by requirement management, this can be a post-it on the wall with wire connecting them. This would like work for very small projects. For most, and rapid changing projects this would not work. So we need a tool

## Requirement management tool

TODO

[] create a list of available tools
[] compare the tools
[] see if still make sense to explore own solution
[] add conclusion
