# Context:

I have hobby's and interests.

I have many hobby's and interests.

I have to many hobby's and interests.

I use this website to keep track and get them out of my head and in text form.

## How do my hobby's work:

I am fond of learning, so I can learn something new for the fun of it. To prevent my to try to learn everything, which is really hard, I want to give myself a direction. Or rather a platform as I call it. This is a large project/hobby which I can use as a objective for my learnings.

To give an example, to learn about robotics and machine learning, I have created the project for a robot that can row. This utilizes my knowledge of rowing and allows for switching between subjects without to big of a context switch.

Another example is the requirement management tool. This is mostly high level writing about the concepts but adds options for user interface design and backend server technologies. As bonus this tool can help with other projects, too.
